**# Welcome to Project-Breyta**

**### What is Project-Breyta?**
Project-Breyta was conceived in the tunnels of London. While "refueling" the London pass and idea was conceived... Why can't this be done with cash? And so, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, Project-Breyta was born.
*It's time to take back your money!*
*It's time to save your money and earn more for your money!*
*It's time to take control over lost money!*

**### Who is Project-Breyta for?**

**### What is the purpose of Project-Bretya?**
So what is Project-Breyta? Most likely you found out about this site because the founder directed you towards here to learn more. Well, I will keep it simple. 
Project-Breyta in it's simplist form is an online (virtual) piggybank. Unlike crypto-currency, Project-Breyta is geared towards real world currency: the dollar, the yen, the pound and so on. 
Project-Breyta's main goal is to make you a little more rich by not losing what is yours.
Another goal is to help promote business. Project-Breyta provides an outlet for businesses to promote, subscribe, and advertise their business. 
As it is said, the more money the people have in their pockets the more they will spend. Our goal for businesses is to increase customer aquisition without charging an arm and a leg for it. We want the transaction process to have little effect on a businesses decision to adopt and to continue to use Project-Breyta.
